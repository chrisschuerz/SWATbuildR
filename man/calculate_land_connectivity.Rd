\title{Calculate the land object connectivity.}
\usage{
calculate_land_connectivity(data_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_path}{Path of the project data folder}
}
\value{
Writes the land object connections into the table connect_ids in the
data base data/tables.sqlite
}

in and iterates over all land object IDs to calculate the net flux fractions
between the land objects and the water objects.
